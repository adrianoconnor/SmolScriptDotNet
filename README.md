This is a learning project and is in very early development, it is not recommended for any kind of real world use.

The goals of this project are:

1. Learn how compilers and virtual machines work
2. Build a small JS-like langauge
3. Make a run-time and compiler that are very small
4. Make a flexible, portable run-time that can be embedded in other applications
5. Make sure that the run-time is completely sandboxed
